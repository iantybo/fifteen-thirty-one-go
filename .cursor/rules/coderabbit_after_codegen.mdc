## CodeRabbit after codegen/edit cycles

Whenever you make **any code changes** (create/update/delete files), you must run CodeRabbit CLI **before concluding the cycle**:

```bash
coderabbit review --plain --no-color --type all --base main
```

Then:
- Apply the findings (code changes, docs updates, refactors as needed).
- Re-run the command until there are **no findings**.

If you did not change code in the cycle, you can skip CodeRabbit.
